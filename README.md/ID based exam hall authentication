# ID-Based Exam Hall Authentication System

## Description
The ID-Based Exam Hall Authentication System provides a secure and efficient way to verify student identities during exams. Using RFID ID cards and an Arduino Uno, it prevents impersonation, unauthorized entry, and manual errors, ensuring fast, accurate, and reliable authentication.

## Features
- RFID-based student authentication
- Arduino-controlled servo motor and LED feedback
- Enrollment and verification phases
- Admin functions for updating or deleting student records
- Fast, secure, and auditable access control

---

## How It Works
1. **Enrollment Phase:** Students’ RFID cards are registered in the system.
2. **Authentication Phase:** Students scan their cards; the Arduino checks the database.
   - **Success:** Door unlocks, LED flashes once
   - **Failure:** Access denied, LED flashes twice
3. Admins can manage records using a special admin ID card.
